#Pinball Classic

This project was my final for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java and JavaFX. Although still under construction, it represents a significant milestone as my very first software incorporating real-life Earth physics. The application demonstrates my understanding and application of OOP principles, utilizing Java and JavaFX to create interactive and dynamic simulations. This project highlights my ability to blend theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, showcasing real-world physics within a software environment.
